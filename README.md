# OptimizationTheoryGap
This repository contains the source files, bibliography, and supplementary materials for our review on the intersection of dynamical systems and deep learning in medicine. We explore the transition from discrete-time fallacies to continuous-time architectures (Neural ODEs/SNNs), focusing on stability, clinical safety, and theory-driven design.
